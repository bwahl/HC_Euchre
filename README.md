# HC_Euchre

First Iteration/Milestone: As a player, I want to be able to play one round with a given trump suit.

What can be done so far:
- Tell HandPlayManager to play a single hand.
- Ask HandPlayManager how many tricks were won after hand is play.

Classes that were planned but not implemented:
- Game
- GameUI
- CardListUI

Current game play:
- Auto player play a random card from its hand, i.e., not yet following Euchre rules.
